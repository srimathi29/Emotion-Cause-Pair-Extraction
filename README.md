# Emotion-Cause-Pair-Extraction

The goal of our project is to develop and analyze methods for Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) in conversations. 
This task involves not only identifying the emotions present in textual data but also uncovering the underlying causes of these emotions. 
From this study we aim to explore and compare few of many approaches proposed or .implemented for this problem.
